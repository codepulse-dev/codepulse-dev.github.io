It allows developers to build applications quickly and easily by leveraging the power of the cloud. With AWS, developers can focus on building their applications without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure.\n\n### Let's Begin\n\nSo now you have basic understanding of what AWS is, let's begin with the topics.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-05T23:20:56.609858347+05:30","tags":null},"/Before-Starting":{"title":"Before Starting","content":"\n[\\_index](_index.md)\n\n### How to Improve my productivity in backend development?\n\n1. [Develop a systems approach](Develop%20a%20systems%20approach.md). Develop an orderly, methodical process for managing your workflow that addresses your specific type of work and environment. Break down big tasks into smaller chunks or steps, and plan out timelines for completing them.\n\n1. [Eliminate distractions](Eliminate%20distractions.md). This can include limiting the number of software programs you open at one time or disabling notifications from unnecessary websites or apps.\n\n1. [Automate repetitive tasks]() wherever possible. Take advantage of features offered in existing tools and frameworks to automate redundant functions instead of manually performing them. This can save you considerable amounts of time which can then be used to complete more meaningful tasks in your development workflow.\n\n1. Implement [methods for reducing stress levels during work hours](), such as meditation or other forms of deep relaxation exercises which help to keep you focused on the task at hand as well as provide much needed relaxation throughout the day. \n\n1. Invest in quality tools, such as a [reliable text editor](), [code versioning tool]() and [code debugging tool]() that help to speed up the development process over time by minimizing configuration hassle and always providing quality output of whatever task has been streamlined through automation with that respective tool set. \n\n1. Employ [visualization techniques for grasping complex development concepts]() quickly and easily by creating easy-to-understand visuals instead of only relying on hard-to-read coding language syntaxes that might take longer to comprehend; this approach also serves as a wonderful refresher when coding compliances have become hazy over time without being properly attended to in a visualism manner from the onset.. \n\n1. [Stay organized and compartmentalize distinct aspects of development projects into intuitively legible sections]() for easier revisiting or further development when needed; this reduces overall research time significantly since it limits reliance on hunting around through procedures that were originally established yet were forgotten over course due to scope creep so projects don’t become overwhelmed with unstructured changes constantly occurring at all ends.. ​\n\n### How should i effectively manage my software development using Todoist and Obsidian without getting distracted?\n\n1. Create a schedule and stick to it – One of the key ways to effectively manage your software development using Todoist and Obsidian is to create a schedule for when you will be working and stick to it. This will help you stay focused on the task at hand, as well as make sure that you don't get distracted by other tasks or distractions. \n\n1. Use Todoist to set up tasks and milestones – In order to effectively manage your software development, use Todoist to set up specific tasks and milestones. This will make it easier for you to track your progress, making sure that tasks are completed in time and according to your planned schedule. \n\n1. Break down large projects into smaller tasks – When working on larger projects, divide them into smaller, more manageable tasks so that they don't seem overwhelming. This will make it easier for you to keep track of everything being done, ensuring you stay on top of the development process. \n\n1. Utilize Obsidian for organization – Using Obsidian for organization can help keep all of your projects in one place, which makes keeping track easier and can help prevent distractions from external sources such as emails or phone messages from incoming customers or clients. \n\n1. Take breaks regularly – Make sure that you take regular small breaks while working in software development as this will help with productivity levels by helping keep your focus sharp while working on complex problems or code writing sessions. \n\n1. Automate where possible - Some elements of software development can be automated if possible. Automation can help take mundane tasks off your plate and reduce the risk of errors due to human error by introducing a more consistent process flow throughout the life cycle of a project\n\n### How to better utilize Obsidian and Todoist as a backend developer?\n\nObsidian and Todoist both can be great tools for managing tasks as a backend developer. Using these two tools together in tandem can help to maximize efficiency and productivity.\n\nFirst, when setting up Obsidian, you want to create a structure to organize your notes and tasks. Break down individual projects into subtopics or tasks, giving each one its own note file. This way, you can quickly refer back to any note you have created while coding. \n\nYou can then use Todoist's labeling feature to easily filter through even more detailed information of the tasks you have completed and still need to complete. Additionally, setting due dates in Todoist can keep you within specific timelines for any given project. \n\nYou could also use Obsidian's powerful search tool to help find past notes quickly when needed. With those notes, you can set up backlinks from Todoist by inserting them as comments along with each task so that all of related notes remain connected across different pieces of work. This will allow you to properly schedule maintenance work or further enhancements after development work is done using topics saved in Obsidian. \n\nCombining these two tools allows developers to better manage their workload without having to spend extra time navigating third-party apps or taking detailed notes in external documents. A more streamlined development process leads to higher productivity and efficiency overall, not just during the backend development process but also with future maintenance and enhancement changes down the line.\n\n### How to better utilize Obsidian, Notion and Todoist together as a backend developer for higher productivity?\n\nThe most effective way to better utilize Obsidian, Notion, and Todoist together as a backend developer to increase productivity is by creating a comprehensive workflow. Here are some tips for making the most of all three apps: \n\n* Start by creating a project dashboard in Obsidian and adding related links to Notion and Todoist. This will allow you to see all your tasks in one place, as well as quickly access supporting documentation. \n* Use Notion to create tasks and add notes and supporting documentation related to projects in one central place. Make sure to link any corresponding tasks in Todoist. \n* Utilize Todoist for your daily task management. Set up custom views utilizing the custom filters that allow you to segment tasks with labels and categories. \n* Finally, use Obsidian for creative planning and brainstorming on future projects or ideas that can be implemented using the resources from Notion and Todoist. This feature can help you quickly put ideas into words without losing focus on current projects and tasks.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-05T23:20:56.613858396+05:30","tags":null},"/Develop-a-systems-approach":{"title":"Develop a systems approach","content":"\n### How to [Develop a systems approach](Develop%20a%20systems%20approach.md) ?\n\n1. Identify the main components and critical relationships of the system. \n\nBegin by taking a step back and looking for ways to break down the system into its various components, processes, and structures. By studying how individual components and processes interact with one another, you can begin to identify relationships within the system. \n\n2. Define measurable objectives for each component of the system. \n\nEach component of the system should be evaluated to determine its function, purpose and performance goals. When these objectives are clearly defined, it becomes possible to measure the success or failure of each component, thereby providing feedback for future improvements. \n\n3. Create a process flow chart that maps out how each component interacts with each other. \n\nCreating a process flow chart that clearly illustrates each component's role in the whole system helps to ensure that everyone involved in creating or interacting with it has a shared understanding of how it all works together as a single unit. The clear visual representation also easily highlights any potential problems or areas of improvement before they become major issues.\n\n4. Develop an algorithm that can be used to evaluate the performance of all components at once. \n\nRather than evaluating each component individually, algorithms can be developed which take into account their interactions as a whole in order to assess the overall performance level of the system as a whole. This allows for a more holistic approach when addressing design problems or generating solutions for improvement opportunities as it takes into account a variety of factors which may not have otherwise been considered separately. \nstrategy here gives an ultimate outcome or goal you might hope for by using systematic methods your systems approach should lead you there;for example if you develope an appreticeship program for workers your systems approach may include understanding your current work force needs ,budget availabiltiy ,outline goals from core competences required from employees ,delegating trainig protocols among team members and supervisors .\n\n### How to use Obsidian and Todoist for the same?\n\nOne way to develop a systems approach using Obsidian and Todoist is to create dedicated projects in both platforms that track progress on the same goal or project. This allows you to use the features of both platforms independently and in combination. \n\nFor example, use Obsidian for tracking progress from a big-picture perspective, such as creating concepts maps, researching and synthesizing information, tracking tasks, and creating notes. Use Todoist to track more tangible goals that you can check off as complete or partially complete. \n\nYou can also link the two systems together by connecting them through Zapier (www.zapier.com/apps/todoist), which allows updates on one platform (such as mark a task completed in Todoist) to result an action on the other platform (such as automatically adding a note in Obsidian). However you decide to integrate your two systems, having two dedicated projects that track progress on the same goal or project will help you maintain momentum and focus as you pursue a systems approach.\n\n### How to [Develop a systems approach](Develop%20a%20systems%20approach.md) as a developer?\n\n1. Understand the components of a system: A system is made up of several components that interact with each other, such as hardware, software, data, and people. Take a hands-on approach to understanding how each of these pieces fit together. \n\n1. Analyze the system: Investigate the way in which these components work together to solve problems or satisfy requirements. Look for common patterns and opportunities for improvement. \n\n1. Develop abstractions: Once you have a firm understanding of how each component works, build abstractions that allow you to reason about the behavior of the system more easily. This could include higher-level classes or components that wrap low-level details from multiple subsystems into one logical grouping. \n\n1. Design for scalability and resiliency: Be sure to plan for future growth when designing your system, and make sure there are failsafes in place to protect yourself from unexpected circumstances. \n\n1. Test comprehensively: Take advantage of automated testing tools and make sure your tests provide adequate coverage of corner cases, performance bottlenecks, and edge communities related to the system’s functionality. \n\n1. Monitor your systems: Use metrics and logging mechanisms in order to detect issues before they become critical or widely known issues in production systems. This can help you uncover underlying problems early on in the development process before they become major issues for customers or developers alike.\n\n### Tools to help [Develop a systems approach](Develop%20a%20systems%20approach.md) as a developer\n\n1. Systematic Planning: To develop a successful systems approach to developing software, planning ahead is essential. Using project planning tools such as Gantt charts or Kanban boards, as well as other software development tools such as coding tracks and version control systems, can make the process much easier to track progress and coordinate tasks.\n\n1. Understanding Requirements: The best way to develop a successful systems approach is to have a full understanding of the requirements of the project. This means that developers need to be able to understand the scope, budget and timeline for the project in order to ensure that it is produced in an efficient manner. Using requirement gathering tools such as interviews or workshops can help to ensure that all relevant parties are informed about what needs to be accomplished and how this can be done efficiently.\n\n1. Use Design Thinking: Design thinking is used by many developers today in order to help with problem solving, innovation and collaboration. By incorporating design thinking into the software development process, developers can create more effective systems solutions which meet customer’s needs.\n\n1. Test Early and Often: Testing any new system early and often is essential in ensuring that it meets customer’s requirements and performs without fail as expected within the specified timeframes. Regularly testing also helps developers identify problems they may have missed during development or during testing, allowing them to make quick corrections so that the system will function correctly when it is live in production mode. \n\n1. Analyze Metrics for Continuous Improvement: Collecting performance metrics throughout development helps keep track of system failure statistics which can be used for continuous improvement of future projects and systems processes (even when none exist). Gathering insights from these metrics helps provide a more reliable system solution each time one is released into production mode.\n\n### How to [Develop a systems approach](Develop%20a%20systems%20approach.md) as a developer using Obsidian and Todoist?\n\nFirst, before beginning to develop a systems approach with Obsidian and Todoist, you will want to make sure to [have a plan in place](have%20a%20plan%20in%20place.md). This plan should address the problem/goal you are attempting to address, your timelines, and the overall workflow processes. \n\nOnce you have a plan in place, it is time to begin developing with Obsidian and Todoist. Obsidian is a powerful tool for knowledge management and note-taking, allowing developers to easily access their notes, organize them into tables or outlines, embed images and videos into notes, among other use cases. \n\nTodoist is a task management platform that allows users to easily create tasks for themselves (or teammates) and manage due dates. Both tools have integrations with each other which allow for even further project and workflow management capabilities. \n\nFor example, using both Obsidian and Todoist together can help the development process by breaking the system down into smaller tasks for quicker execution within the larger development goal. The developer can use Obsidian notes to track progress and store research from outside sources that can be easily referenced later on. For instance, they can create an “implementation” note type or tag which would indicate all tasks related directly only work involved with implementation of their goals. Also they can set due dates on specific tasks in Todoist which will appear automatically as clickable links in the specified obsidian notebook(which makes it easier for managing small tasks). All of this information will help ensure that project completion stay on track  as changes occur throughout development process.\n\nBy using a combination of both tools together in this manner (alongside any collaborators), developers are able to maintain a systems approach from start to finish while still remaining organized along the way.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-05T23:20:56.613858396+05:30","tags":null},"/Eliminate-distractions":{"title":"Eliminate distractions","content":"\n### How to [Eliminate distractions](Eliminate%20distractions.md) as a developer?\n\n1. Turn off notifications: Notifications can be a huge distraction. This can be especially true for mobile apps and social media notifications. Make sure to disable any notifications that you don't need and keep the ones that are important muted. \n\n1. Use noise canceling headphones: Listening to music or podcasts without lyrics while you're coding can be a great way to eliminate distractions and focus on what you are doing. Using noise canceling headphones is a great way to limit distracting noises like people talking or the hum of an air conditioner. \n\n1. Close unrelated applications: Eliminate distractions by closing down programs other than coding or directly related programs, such as reference material, your IDE, and compilers/ debuggers. This draw less of your attention elsewhere while programming. \n\n1. Keep your workspace organized: An inefficient workspace can take away from your time as you might spend extra time searching for something you need but don't remember where you put it or trying to work around the clutter instead of focusing on coding. Make sure everything is well organized so it’s easier for you to stay focused and in the zone for coding work\n\n1. Choose a specific time to answer emails: Responding to emails throughout the day is often seen as necessary, but if it distracts from your actual job tasks then its best that you create specific blocks on your calendar when responding to emails each day in order to stay focused on what really matters - coding!\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-05T23:20:56.605858298+05:30","tags":null},"/have-a-plan-in-place":{"title":"Have a plan in place","content":"\n### How to make a plan before starting the development?\n\n1. Develop a clear overview of the system: Identify the goal, analyze the environment and determine resources available to accomplish it. This overview should contain an overarching scope, objectives, and requirements for success.\n\n1. Build a network or map of all activities needed to complete the system: This can be done using brainstorming, process flow diagrams, and other visual models. This step should provide an end to end view of all tasks that need to be completed in order for the system reach completion as desired.\n\n1. Create a timeline or schedule for completing activities: Based on the network map created in Step 2, create a timeline that clearly outlines what needs to happen by when in order to complete each task and reach the goal. \n\n1. Allocate resources to each activity: Based on resource availability and urgency of each task it is important to allocate resources accordingly and have contingency plans ready if needed. \n\n1. Monitor progress on activities across time: Monitor progress both in real time and as a whole as well as test components/segments/systems as they are completed against expectations/requirements set out in Step 1. Make adjustments as needed along the way while consistently referring back to plan created in previous steps (steps 1 – 4). \n\n1. Review system at completion stage: After all tasks are completed review system-wide performance against objectives established in Step 1; if necessary make final adjustments or modifications before officially declaring success; document any reminders for future implementations of project/systems should similar ones need to be implemented again.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-05T23:20:56.605858298+05:30","tags":null}}
